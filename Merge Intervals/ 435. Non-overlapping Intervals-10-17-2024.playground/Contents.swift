 # 435. Non-overlapping Intervals
 [LeetCode Problem 435](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)

 Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]`, return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

 ## Example 1:

 - **Input**: `intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]`
 - **Output**: `1`
 - **Explanation**: Removing interval `[1,3]` leaves the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

 ## Example 2:

 - **Input**: `intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]`
 - **Output**: `2`
 - **Explanation**: You need to remove two `[1,2]` to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

 ## Example 3:

 - **Input**: `intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]`
 - **Output**: `0`
 - **Explanation**: You don't need to remove any intervals since they are already non-overlapping.

 ## Constraints:

 - `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5`
 - `intervals[i].length == 2`
 - `-5 * 10^4 <= start_i < end_i <= 5 * 10^4`

 ## Topics:
 - Arrays
 - Greedy
 - Sorting
