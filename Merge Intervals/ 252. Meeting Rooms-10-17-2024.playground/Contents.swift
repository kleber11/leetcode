/**
 # 252. Meeting Rooms
 [LeetCode Problem 252](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms/)

 Given an array of meeting time intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]`, determine if a person could attend all meetings.

 ## Example 1:

 - **Input**: `intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]`
 - **Output**: `false`
 - **Explanation**: A person cannot attend all meetings since they overlap (e.g., meeting 1 overlaps with meeting 2).

 ## Example 2:

 - **Input**: `intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]`
 - **Output**: `true`
 - **Explanation**: There is no overlap between the two meetings.

 ## Constraints:

 - `0 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
 - `intervals[i].length == 2`
 - `0 <= start_i < end_i <= 10^6`

 ## Topics:
 - Arrays
 - Sorting
 - Intervals
