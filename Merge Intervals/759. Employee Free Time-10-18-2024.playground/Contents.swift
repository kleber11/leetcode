 # 759. Employee Free Time
 [LeetCode Problem 759](https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-free-time/)

 We are given a list `schedule` of employees, where each employee has a list of non-overlapping `intervals`. Each interval `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represents the start and the end time of that employee's work period.

 Return a list of finite intervals representing **common, positive-length free time** for all employees, also in the form of intervals.

 ## Example 1:

 - **Input**: `schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]`
 - **Output**: `[[3,4]]`
 - **Explanation**: There are a total of three employees, and their schedules are:
   - Employee 1: `[1, 2], [5, 6]`
   - Employee 2: `[1, 3]`
   - Employee 3: `[4, 10]`
   - The common free time is `[3, 4]`.

 ## Example 2:

 - **Input**: `schedule = [[[1,3],[6,7]],[[2,4]],[[2,5],[9,12]]]`
 - **Output**: `[[5,6],[7,9]]`

 ## Constraints:

 - `1 <= schedule.length , schedule[i].length <= 50`
 - `0 <= start_i < end_i <= 10^8`

 ## Topics:
 - Arrays
 - Sorting
 - Intervals
