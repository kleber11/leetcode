 # 986. Interval List Intersections
 [LeetCode Problem 986](https://leetcode.com/problems/interval-list-intersections/)

 You are given two lists of closed intervals, `firstList` and `secondList`, where `firstList[i] = [start_i, end_i]` and `secondList[j] = [start_j, end_j]`. Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

 Return the intersection of these two interval lists. A closed interval `[a, b]` (with `a <= b`) denotes the intersection of two intervals, and it is an interval that is present in both interval lists.

 ## Example 1:

 - **Input**: `firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]]`, `secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]`
 - **Output**: `[[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]`

 ## Example 2:

 - **Input**: `firstList = [[1,3],[5,9]]`, `secondList = [[4,8]]`
 - **Output**: `[[5,8]]`

 ## Constraints:

 - `0 <= firstList.length, secondList.length <= 1000`
 - `firstList[i].length == 2`
 - `secondList[j].length == 2`
 - `0 <= start_i <= end_i <= 10^9`
 - `0 <= start_j <= end_j <= 10^9`

 ## Topics:
 - Arrays
 - Two Pointers
 - Intervals
