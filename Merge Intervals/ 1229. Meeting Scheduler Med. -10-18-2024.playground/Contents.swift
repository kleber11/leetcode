 # 1229. Meeting Scheduler
 [LeetCode Problem 1229](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-scheduler/)

 Given the availability of two people, represented by two lists of closed intervals `slots1` and `slots2`, where `slots1[i] = [start_i, end_i]` and `slots2[j] = [start_j, end_j]`, find the earliest time slot that works for both people and is of duration at least `duration`.

 If there is no common time slot that satisfies the duration requirement, return an empty array.

 The time slots are represented by finite intervals `[start, end]` where `start` and `end` are integers that represent the start and the end of the slot (inclusive).

 ## Example 1:

 - **Input**: `slots1 = [[10,50],[60,120],[140,210]]`, `slots2 = [[0,15],[60,70]]`, `duration = 8`
 - **Output**: `[60,68]`

 ## Example 2:

 - **Input**: `slots1 = [[10,50]], slots2 = [[60,120]], duration = 8`
 - **Output**: `[]`

 ## Constraints:

 - `1 <= slots1.length, slots2.length <= 10^4`
 - `slots1[i].length == slots2[j].length == 2`
 - `0 <= start_i < end_i <= 10^9`
 - `1 <= duration <= 10^6`

 ## Topics:
 - Arrays
 - Sorting
 - Two Pointers
